Endosulfan is a broad-spectrum nonsystemic contact and stomach insecticide effective for sucking, chewing, and boring insects. This pesticide is said to be neurotoxic to both insects and mammals, including humans. It is a chloride channel and inhibits calcium and magnesium ATPase, which are enzymes used in nerve impulses [2].

However, since profenofos is an organophosphate pesticide, It is classified as moderately hazardous or toxicity class II by the World Health Organization [5]. The possible side effects of profenofos, according to the U.S Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), are nausea, confusion, and dizziness. If exposed to a higher dose of the profenofos, there is a chance of respiratory paralysis due to inhalation or ingestion of the pesticide, and worst it can cause fatality.

Acephate is applied to the plants. Once the pests ingest the treated plants, then they also ingest the acephate that was applied. Acephate and methamidophos affect the nervous system of pests or insects, causing over-activity on its nerves, muscle, or brain. Additionally, acephate is less toxic to mammals since the bodies of mammals do not turn acephate into methamidophos.
